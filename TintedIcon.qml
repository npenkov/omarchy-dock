// App-icon artwork, optionally colorized to a single ink colour.
//
// Tinting is what lets an arbitrary app icon sit next to the curated
// glyphs without breaking the theme: MultiEffect's colorization maps the
// icon's luminance onto the ink colour, so shape and shading survive but
// every hue becomes the theme's. The untinted path is the plain Image
// exactly as v1 drew it.
