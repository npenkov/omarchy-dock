-- Hyprland's blur is a global switch: a layer rule opts a surface in, but
-- nothing renders while decoration.blur is off. Turning it on would normally
-- mean every window pays for blur too — Omarchy tags windows at 0.985/0.96
-- opacity, so they are translucent enough to trigger it for no visible gain.
-- The window rule below opts them all back out, leaving the dock as the only
-- surface actually blurred.

-- ignore_alpha keeps the blur from bleeding through the fully transparent
-- parts of the dock's surface, so only the card itself is frosted.
